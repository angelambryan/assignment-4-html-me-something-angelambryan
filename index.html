         <p>Spending time with family is always wonderful, however spending a week together in the Caribbean is amazing! 
            My family means everything to me and it's so important to create and make memories together. 
            The things I enjoy on our family vacations are going on excursions, hanging at the beach,  
            nightly dinners together, and just relaxing enjoying each others company. 
            There is nothing better and I look forward to my next family vacation!</p>
