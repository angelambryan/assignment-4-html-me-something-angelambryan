         <p>Spending time with family is always wonderful, however spending a week together in the Caribbean is amazing! 
            My family means everything to me and it's so important to create and make memories together. 
            Some of the things I enjoy are going on excursions together, soaking up sun on the beach, hanging out at the pool, 
            have dinner together nightly, and just relaxing enjoying each others company. There is nothing better!</p>
